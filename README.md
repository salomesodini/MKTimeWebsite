<br>
💻 The website has been created as a portfolio piece for the course "CodeSpace Academy - Induction" within Edinburgh College.

# The brief:
<br>
The brief asked us to create a website for MK TIME, a growing e-commerce business, that sells Swiss watches designed and producted in Edinburgh. They offer their customers high-quality products, with an excellent refund and repair policy. 
<br>
<br>
📚 As a portfolio piece at the end of the Edinburgh College six-week course "Code Space - Induction", we were asked to create a simple wesbite with at least:
<br>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>A landing page</li>
  <li>A product page</li>
  <li>A registration page (with a form)</li>
  <li>A login page (with a form)</li>
</ol>
<br>
I started creating my landing page, using the Bootstrap Framework. It was a lot of fun and easier than I expected! I am really grateful for the Bootstrap Framework, as - a beginner - I managed to get together a decent website relatively quickly! With the help of Bootstrap, I created the structure of my page in HTML, and I used CSS for the styling - my favourite part 🖌️
<br>
<br>
From the strcture of my landing page, which has a main title, a navbar and a bottom bar, I created all the rest: my product page (I did only the men collection as an example) and my forms. I used Bootstrap again to create the forms - registration and login, as requested by the brief, but I also made a refund form. The brief only asked for front-end, so the forms on the website are not currently working. I am planning to add some back-end in the future!
<br>
<br>
I also added an Under Construction page, as I did not want to have sections going nowhere! And it is a remind for me to keep working on this project. 
<br>
<br>
🍀 I hope you liked this project, and I hope that MK Time customers will be happy too!
